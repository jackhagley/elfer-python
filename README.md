-----------------
What is the game?
-----------------
Elfer Raus is a card game for 2+ players. Cards are numbered 1-20 and come in four colours. Each card must be played in sequence with cards of the same colour. The first card in the sequence must be the 11 (ELFER). Once the 11 is played from a colour it means that the 10 or 12 from that colour can be played, and so on. If a player cannot play a card they must pick up from the pile. If the pile is empty they must miss a turn. The first player to have an empty hand is the winner. 

-----------------
What does this do?
-----------------
This is a 0 player simulation of the card game. It has four bot players (Ash, Bev, Col, Dom) that play cards at random. It plays 10 rounds of the game, and reports which of the players won.

-----------------
OK but why
-----------------
I made this because I wanted to have a game to train a bot on. So I could see the strategies that it used and copy them to beat my family members.
